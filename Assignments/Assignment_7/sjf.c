// Write a program to generate random CPU-burst times (each in the range 10 â€“ 40 milliseconds) for ten
// processes (say, P1, P2, ..., P10). Based on this information, your program should pick processes one by one
// to be scheduled at CPU, depending on each of the following CPU-scheduling algorithms. For each of these
// algorithms, your program should print the order of the scheduled processes and compute the average
// waiting time for these processes.

/*
 * Explanation of Key Variables:
 * - `n`: Number of processes, set to 10 for this example.
 * - `bt[]`: Array of burst times, randomly generated for each process.
 * - `check[]`: Boolean array to track which processes have been scheduled.
 * - `wait_t[]`: Array for the waiting times of each process.
 * - `turn_ar_t[]`: Array for the turnaround times of each process.
 * - `last`: Index of the last process executed, used to compute waiting time for the current process.
 * - `curr`: Index of the current process with the shortest burst time.
 *
 * Explanation of the Algorithm:
 * 1. The code generates random burst times for 10 processes.
 * 2. It finds the process with the shortest burst time that has not been scheduled and executes it.
 * 3. The waiting time for each process is the cumulative burst time of all previous processes.
 * 4. The turnaround time is the waiting time plus the burst time for each process.
 * 5. The program calculates and prints the average waiting and turnaround times.
 *
 * How the SJF Algorithm Minimizes Waiting Time:
 * - The SJF algorithm minimizes waiting time by prioritizing processes with shorter burst times, ensuring that shorter processes are completed quickly.
