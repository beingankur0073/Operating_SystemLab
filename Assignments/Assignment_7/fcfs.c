// Write a program to generate random CPU-burst times (each in the range 10 â€“ 40 milliseconds) for ten
// processes (say, P1, P2, ..., P10). Based on this information, your program should pick processes one by one
// to be scheduled at CPU, depending on each of the following CPU-scheduling algorithms. For each of these
// algorithms, your program should print the order of the scheduled processes and compute the average
// waiting time for these processes.

/*
 * Explanation of Key Variables:
 * - `n`: Number of processes, set to 10 for this example.
 * - `bt[]`: Array of burst times, randomly generated for each process.
 * - `wait_t[]`: Array storing the calculated waiting times for each process.
 * - `turn_ar_t[]`: Array storing the calculated turnaround times for each process.
 * - `avg_wt_t` and `avgturn_ar_t`: Variables to store the average waiting time and average turnaround time, respectively.

 * How the Code Works:
 * 1. The code generates random burst times for 10 processes.
 * 2. It calculates the waiting time for each process based on the cumulative burst times of previous processes.
 * 3. It calculates the turnaround time (waiting time + burst time) for each process.
 * 4. It prints a table of burst times, waiting times, and turnaround times for all processes.
 * 5. Finally, it calculates and displays the average waiting time and turnaround time across all processes.

 * Notes:
 * - The code uses the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, where each process is served in the order it arrives.
 * - The program generates random burst times, which could be changed by modifying the `rand` parameters.
 * - `printf` statements are used for displaying process information in a formatted table, followed by averages.
