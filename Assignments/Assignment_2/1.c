/*
 * Explanation of Key Functions:
 * - fork(): Creates a new process. It returns 0 to the child process and the childâ€™s PID to the parent.
 * - getpid() and getppid(): 
 *   - getpid(): Retrieve the current process ID.
 *   - getppid(): Retrieve the parent process ID.
 * - wait(): The parent process calls wait() to pause execution until the child process completes,
 *           helping to prevent zombie processes (a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table).
 *
 * How the Code Works:
 * 1. The program starts by including necessary headers for I/O and process control.
 * 2. It defines two variables to hold process IDs.
 * 3. The main function calls fork() to create a child process.
 * 4. Depending on the return value of fork():
 *    - The parent process waits for the child to finish using wait() and prints its PID along with the child's PID.
 *    - The child process prints its own PID and its parent's PID.
 * 5. The program terminates after both processes have executed their respective code blocks.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Zombie Processes: Without wait(), if the parent process completes before the child, the child becomes a zombie,
 *                    which is a process that has finished executing but still has an entry in the process table.
 * - Platform Behavior: The output order can differ across systems because process scheduling is managed by the OS.
